This is the complete source code to Reminder Hero - a SaaS product that I launched in 2013.

Code has been sanitized for removal of secrets, but other than that it's in the exact state that I left it in many years ago. I don't currently have a machine that can build this, so you're on your own.

The web app is written in C# and the parsing logic is written in F#.
