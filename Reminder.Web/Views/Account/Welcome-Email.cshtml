<h3>Configuring your email addresses</h3>
<h4>We've already set up the email address you've registered with!</h4>
<h4>If you upgrade your price plan and want to create text message reminders, or email reminders from other email addresses, you need to register your  @Html.ActionLink("phone numbers", "PhoneNumbers") and @Html.ActionLink("email addresses", "EmailAddresses"). </h4>

<h3>Creating Reminders</h3>
<h4>To create email reminders, email your reminders to <a href="mailto:reminder@example.com">reminder@example.com</a>.</h4>

<h3>Reminder Tips</h3>
<h4>When sending us your reminders, make sure to include both a what and a when!</h4> 
<h4>When specifying times, include AM or PM to ensure that Reminder Hero knows which one you want!</h4>
<h4>You can create reminders for specific dates and times, or for time periods. Here are some examples:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>"Send Tim the reports in 20 min"</li>
    <li>"Put out the garbage every Monday at 9 am"</li>
    <li>"Tape the game on channel 135 tomorrow at 4:30pm"</li>
</ul>
